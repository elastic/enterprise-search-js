== Overview

Official universal JavaScript client for Elastic App Search and Workplace Search.
This module differs from the normal Node.js client as it can be used both in Node.js
and the browser environment.
Another important difference is that this client does not support every API that the
normal Node.js client supports, as it's designed to work with lower permissions.

IMPORTANT: This module expects to find the `fetch` API in the global environment, if you need to use it in Node.js
as well, you can add it with https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch[`cross-fetch`].
